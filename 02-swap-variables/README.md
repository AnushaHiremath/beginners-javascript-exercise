# `02` Swap two variables
In this example, you will learn to write a program to swap two variables in JavaScript

## üìù Instructions:

1. Here we create a `temp` variable to store the value of `a` temporarily.

2. We assign the value of b to a.

3. The value of temp is assigned to b.

As a result, the value of the variables are swapped.

**Note:** You can also swap strings or other data types using this method.


```js
//JavaScript program to swap two variables

//take input from the users
let a = prompt('Enter the first variable: ');
let b = prompt('Enter the second variable: ');

//create a temporary variable
let temp;

//swap variables
temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;

console.log(`The value of a after swapping: ${a}`);
console.log(`The value of b after swapping: ${b}`);
```
